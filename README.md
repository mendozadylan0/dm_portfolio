**Context:**\
![21-mktc-05288-pitneybowe-logo-1100x400-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82073881/151914933-a97cf1c9-2bc8-4c7f-9c10-28d6434e9d11.jpg)

Pitney Bowes uses predictive maintenance to reduce down-times of mailing meters. Pitney Bowes' mailing meters are an integral part of their clients' business operations. As a result, they must be able to proactively identify potential complications early on to avoid service disruptions for their clients. Predictive maintenance allows the company to have the required replacement parts where they are needed. Additionally, predictive maintenance also allows the aforementioned company to proactively schedule appointments with customers if needed.

**Objective:**\
Using the training sample provided by the Pitney Bowes team, build a model that can reliably predict which meters will fail within the next 7 days (7 days from data collection). Defining the KPI's for measuring the performance of the model was left up to the team's discretion.

**Tools Used:**\
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Imblearn, Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME)

**Context:**\
The data sets used for this project are the *311 Service Requests from 2010 to Present* filtered by Street Light Complaints and the *Motor Vehicle Collisions - Crashes*. Both data sets were sourced from NYC OpenData. Records used in this project are dated between January 2019 and December 2021.

The ETL was performed using Python, Socrata's OpenData API, and Google BigQuery's python connector packages and API. Data is hosted on Google BigQuery. Ad-hoc analysis and dashboarding were both performed using Tableau.

**Objective:**\
Given the data sets that were selected for this project, try to answer the following questions:
- Which borough had the most crashes?
- Which borough saw the most fatalities related to car crashes?
- What were the most prevalent 311 complaints regarding street lights for every borough?

**Tools Used:**\
Python, Pandas, Google BigQuery, Socrata OpenData API, Tableau
